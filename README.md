# Jet Fuel

Jet Fuel is a URL shortened application. This was our first project for the mod and also the first time building a backend. Jet Fuel allows users to shorten long url into nice and shorl ones they can store away and save. Each shortenrd URL can be stored in a unique folder that can store multiple URL'S. We can also track the usage and keep track of how popular URL's are compared to others through a 'visits' that keeps track of how many times a URL has been visited.

## Design

We focused our app heavily on the mobile view for the user and adapted that for the bigger screens. We wanted a very clean and straight forward look so the user could see all of the folders right away.

If we had more time I think it would be cool to add users so that the links that you add are all your own.
